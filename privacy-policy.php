            <h2 class="mt-4">CHOICES AND ACCESS</h2>
            
            <p>Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information. We give you choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes. You may opt out from:</p>
            
            <p>Receiving marketing communications from us: If you no longer want to receive marketing communications from us on a going forward basis, you may opt out of receiving them by contacting us via email at SHINECagayanValley@gmail.com.</p>
              
            <p>Our sharing of your personal information with affiliates and third party partners:  If you previously opted in to receiving marketing communications from our affiliates or third party partners, you may opt out of our sharing of your personal information with those parties for their direct marketing purposes on a going forward basis by contacting us via SHINECagayanValley@gmail.com.

Please note that if you opt out as described above, we will not be able to remove your personal information from the databases of our affiliates with which we have already shared your information (i.e., as of the date that we implement your optout request). Please also note that if you opt out of receiving marketing related messages from us, we may still send you important transactional and administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out.</p>
            
            <p><b>How you can access, change, or delete your personal information?</b> If you would like to review, correct, update, restrict, or delete your personal information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent these rights are provided to you by applicable law), please contact us via SHINECagayanValley@gmail.com.

            <p>Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or service providers, and by using our Service or by providing consent to us (where required by law), your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country. Appropriate contractual and other measures are in place to protect personal information when it is transferred to our affiliates or third parties in other countries.</p>
            
            <p>Some non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available here https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en.) For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have ensured that adequate measures are in place, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by [EU Standard Contractual Clauses, EU-US Privacy Shield Certification, or an EU-approved code of conduct or certification], to protect your Personal Information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting our data protection officer in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">SECURITY</h2>

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

            <h2 class="mt-4">RETENTION PERIOD</h2>
            <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Service to you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).</p>
            
            <p>For example, if we collect your personal information for marketing analytics purposes, we will store it for a period of one year, with a starting point of retention period, e.g., receipt of the request, closing of the contest, receipt of the complaint.</p>
            
            <p>Please note, however, that this is not an exhaustive list of retention periods. Your personal information may be stored for a longer period using the criteria set forth in the first paragraph of this section, especially points (ii) and (iii).</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</h2>
